# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


This is the completed fifth weekly challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>
This project required us to build an hourly work day scheduler.<br>
According to the grading rubric the scheduler had to meet the following requirements:<br>
- **Requirements**
    - An HTML document that used Bootstrap to create rows and columns, as well as FontAwesome, and GoogleAPIs to style icons and fonts.<br>
    - A Javascipt file that used jQuery and Moment.js to assign time values to variables allowing for task rows to change color depending on if that task was past/present/future. <br>
    - Clicking a save button would save each indivdual task using localStorage.  <br>

## **Motivation**

This was a difficult challenge.  It helped reinforce some very- for me at least- hard-to-grasp concepts.  These included:
- Getting a better handle on JS.
- Gaining a better understanding of vanilla JS/jQuery syntax and structure.
- Using localStorage
- Learning about and implementing:
    - DOM manipulation
    - Using Third Party APIs to style and improve UI<br>  

## **Build Status**

This Work Day Scheduler should be considered complete.    

## **Code Style**

This project was built from the groud up using:
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
- <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a>
- <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">FontAwesome</a>
- <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google APIs</a>
